TL1Toolkit version 0.01
=======================

This Perl module is intended to hide the difficult TL1 syntax from
the user. It executes TL1 commands and returns the results in Perl
data structures. For example, if you work with different types and/or
vendors of devices the TL1 syntax might be different as well as the
output. This TL1 module retrieves information from different types
and/or vendors of devices without having to know the exact details.
There is also a cmd() function to execute any TL1 function. In this
case the user has to parse the returned results. This module is known
to work on Nortel OME6500, Nortel DWDM CPL, Nortel HDXc, Nortel OM5200,
Cisco ONS15454 and Adva FSP3000; but it should work on any TL1 capable
device.
